## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the user understand performances by differert managers at soccer club "Manchester United" since legendary manager Sir Alex Fergusion retired in 2013. 

This covers May 2013 - May 2024.

Please note that it does NOT include the last few matches of the 2024 season where the then manager Eric Ten Hag won the FA Cup. 

It helps the users know which of the managers produces the best results in terms of wins, losses and draws (by count and by percentage). It also shows the users which managers were effective in scoring more goals, and which were effective in winning titles.

# Insights

A 2-page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Reports show that interim manager **Ralf Rangnick** was the worst manager with lowest win percentage (38%), and equal "goals for" and "goals against" per game (1.28) accross 29 matches.

He also had zero (0) titles.

Reports also show that both the caretaker managers **Michael Carrick** and **Ryan Giggs** did not last long enough to be able to get any meaningful conclusions. Although they both had highest "goals for" per game value (2.0), and also lower "goals against" per game than most other managers, they were simply not trusted enough for a long run at their position. Michael Carrick had the highest win rate (66.67%) and no loses, but he only managed 3 games.

Reports also show that amongst the full-time appointed managers, both **Jose Mourinho** and **Eric Ten Hag** have comparable win rates (58% and 57% respectively), and multiple titles. They fared better amongst 8 managers that came in since 2013. Jose Mourinho won three titles and had better "goals against" per game than Eric Ten Hag had by the end of 2024 season. 

However, Eric Ten Hag's number will change as he will continue into 2024-2025 season... and based on the report, the new owners (IENOS group) are right in sticking with him for another season.
